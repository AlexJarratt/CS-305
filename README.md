# CS-305 Software Security

Artemis Financial was a financial firm looking to update, add, and implement to their existing security systems. Specifically they wanted to improve upon their RESTful web application. I believe I identified the vulnerability of test code particularly well. It is important to code securely as this will protect private and personal data that would be particularly devastating to criminial activities if found. Software security adds to a company's overall wellbeing in the form of safety it provides to the customer of the company. I found the areas of security challenging in that determining which type of security issue was at hand as all of them are fairly important as to the safety of the personal data that Artemis Financial is dealing with. I approached the need to increase layers of security by targeting the weak points of the system directly to be improved. I would in future assessments also implement a blanket layer of improvements as a strategy as to help with mitigation determination. I ensured the code and software application was functional and secure by updating all security measures to the most current versions. I checked with a 'Dependency Check' to see if I introduced new vulnerabilities. I find that the dependency check tool would be helpful in future tasks. In this particular assignment I would like to showcase the vulnerability assessment and mitigation plan I formed as I feel that was well done.
